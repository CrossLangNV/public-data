This test ser was crawled from the Europeana website by manually selecting 100 random pages for four subdomains
and extracting about 500 relevant sentences. These sentences were then segmented using the XTM
translation management system and stored as plain text files, while removing all mark-up.
Translation was carried out using the freely available DeepL4 MT system and post-edited, in order to reduce
throughput time and costs. In-house resources (non-native in any of the languages) were used for post-editing. This
set-up is similar to the WMT set up, except that our resources have a linguistic background, and pre-translation is
used instead of translation from scratch.
This effort yielded a test set that is already considerable in size, but probably not sufficiently representative for all
data within the Europeana repository. For the time being, it allows us to get an idea of the content and to test our
hypotheses about potential MT problems.
Test set statistics and example sentences are indicated in the tables below.
